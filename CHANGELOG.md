## CHANGELOG

lists items that might need to run manually.
* 20250509

Added â€“ Support for `extra_models` parameter in the Activity Log API endpoint.
`extra_models`: A comma-separated list of relationship method names to include related models' activities.

When provided, the system will dynamically load specified relationships, and include related models' activities in the query using `orWhere` clauses.
This enhancement allows for broader and more flexible activity retrieval across related models.

Add index to the `type` column in the `activity_logs` table.

            $table->string('title')->nullable()->default('make a change');
        });
